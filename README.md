# Texture Druid (A work in progress)

A very experimental tool written as a Rust learning project. I wanted to make something actually useful while
improving my Rust coding skills. It currently extracts textures from Quake WAD2 files. I eventually hope to use it to 
make a tool for making the workflow of creating maps with new custom textures in the 
[TrenchBroom](https://kristianduske.com/trenchbroom/) map editor easier.
